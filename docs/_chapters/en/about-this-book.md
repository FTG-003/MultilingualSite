# About This Book

Welcome to the Peeragogy Handbook, a resource for self-organizing peer learning. This living document was written by a global community of educators, organizers, and technologists dedicated to helping people learn together effectively.

## What is Peeragogy?

Peeragogy (also known as "paragogy") is a flexible framework for peer-to-peer learning and knowledge sharing. It's about understanding how to create and sustain learning environments that are:

* **Participatory**: Everyone contributes to the learning process
* **Self-organized**: Structure emerges from participant needs rather than being imposed
* **Distributed**: Learning happens across networks of people, places, and platforms
* **Collaborative**: Learning together is more powerful than learning alone
* **Adaptive**: Methods evolve as the community evolves

## History of the Handbook

The Peeragogy project began in 2012 when Howard Rheingold put out a call for collaborators interested in co-creating a resource about co-learning. A global group responded, and we've been iterating on this handbook ever since.

The handbook represents our collective attempt to answer the question: **"How can we most effectively organize peer-learning?"**

## How to Use This Handbook

The handbook is designed to be practical, actionable, and adaptable to your specific context. You can:

1. **Read it sequentially** to get a comprehensive understanding of peeragogy
2. **Dive into specific chapters** that address your immediate needs
3. **Adapt the patterns and methods** to your own peer learning projects
4. **Contribute your own experiences** to help improve future editions

## Core Principles

Our approach is based on these key principles:

* **Peer learning** is powerful and effective when well-organized
* **Feedback and iteration** are essential for improvement
* **Theory and practice** must remain connected
* **Openness and inclusivity** create stronger learning communities
* **Meta-learning** (learning how to learn) is as important as the content

We hope this handbook helps you create meaningful, effective learning experiences, whether you're organizing a study group, teaching a class, coordinating a workshop, or building an online learning community.
