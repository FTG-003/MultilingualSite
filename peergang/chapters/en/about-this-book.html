        <h2>Welcome to PeerGang</h2>
        <p>This handbook introduces a new vision for learning called <strong>PeerGang</strong> - a digital command center where peer learning meets artificial intelligence. It represents a culmination of years of research, experimentation, and collective wisdom from the peeragogy community, now enhanced with the capabilities of modern AI.</p>
        
        <p>Peer learning—learning with and from peers—is an ancient practice that has found new relevance in our digitally connected world. The addition of AI as a collaborator, guide, and amplifier of human potential creates unprecedented opportunities for knowledge creation and sharing.</p>
        
        <p>The PeerGang Handbook serves as both a theoretical framework and a practical guide for anyone interested in revolutionizing how we learn together. Whether you're an educator, student, community organizer, or lifelong learner, the ideas and approaches outlined here will help you harness the collective intelligence of peers and the augmentative power of AI.</p>
      </section>
      
      <section class="chapter-section">
        <h2>A Brief History</h2>
        <p>The concept of peeragogy (also called "paragogy") emerged around 2010 as educators and researchers began exploring how peer-to-peer dynamics were transforming learning in digital spaces. The first Peeragogy Handbook was released in 2013 as a free, open-source project, collaboratively written by a global community of volunteers.</p>
        
        <p>PeerGang builds upon this foundation but makes a significant leap forward by integrating artificial intelligence as a core component of the peer learning ecosystem. This isn't about replacing human connections with technology, but rather about using AI to enhance, facilitate, and expand what's possible when peers come together to learn.</p>
        
        <p>Our approach recognizes that AI can serve multiple roles in peer learning environments:</p>
        
        <ul>
          <li>As a peer that brings unique capabilities and perspectives</li>
          <li>As a facilitator that helps coordinate activities and discussions</li>
          <li>As an amplifier that extends the collective capabilities of the group</li>
          <li>As a bridge that connects different knowledge domains and learning styles</li>
        </ul>
      </section>

        <h2>Core Principles</h2>
        <p>Before diving into specific practices, it's important to understand the foundational principles that guide the PeerGang approach:</p>
        
        <div class="principles-list">
          <div class="principle">
            <h3>Peer Equality</h3>
            <p>Everyone has something valuable to contribute and learn, including AI systems. Leadership is fluid and contextual rather than fixed.</p>
          </div>
          
          <div class="principle">
            <h3>Active Co-Creation</h3>
            <p>Knowledge isn't simply consumed but actively constructed through peer interactions, with AI as a collaborator in this creative process.</p>
          </div>
          
          <div class="principle">
            <h3>Emergent Design</h3>
            <p>The structure and direction of learning emerges from the interests, needs, and contributions of participants rather than being predetermined.</p>
          </div>
          
          <div class="principle">
            <h3>Reflective Practice</h3>
            <p>Continuous reflection on both process and content is essential for deepening learning and improving collaborative dynamics.</p>
          </div>
          
          <div class="principle">
            <h3>Responsible Technology</h3>
            <p>AI should be used ethically, transparently, and in ways that amplify human potential rather than replace human connection.</p>
          </div>
        </div>
