üß† CONTEXT:
The current UI of the Peeragogy Handbook AI Edition looks too basic and does not reflect the power, vision, or professionalism of the PeerGang initiative. It currently resembles a student project or a toy website.

üéØ OBJECTIVE:
Redesign the entire GUI to reflect a clean, elegant, powerful and future-ready AI platform for educational collaboration. The goal is to build something visually impressive and cognitively functional.

üí£ WE NEED:
- A modern, clean, and professional layout
- Excellent typography (spaced headings, readable paragraphs)
- Sticky left sidebar for TOC (with scroll sync)
- AI Sidebar component (placeholder for now, but visually structured)
- Integrated feedback/comment box with smart UX
- Search bar with elegant animation
- Responsive layout for mobile/tablet
- Dark mode ready (optional but appreciated)
- Modular structure (ready for future AI, n8n, Flowise integration)

üìê LAYOUT SUGGESTION:
+-------------------------------+
| LOGO / HEADER / BADGE        |
+-------------------------------+
| TOC Sidebar     |  Chapter    |
| (Sticky + AI)   |  Content    |
+-------------------------------+
| FOOTER          |            |
+-------------------------------+

üî• NOTES:
Forget about language switches and translation for now.
This is not a student site.
This is PeerGang‚Ñ¢. Build something worthy.

üî• GO:
Refactor the layout. Upgrade the visuals. Make it look like it belongs to a global AI-powered education initiative. PeerGang demands it.
