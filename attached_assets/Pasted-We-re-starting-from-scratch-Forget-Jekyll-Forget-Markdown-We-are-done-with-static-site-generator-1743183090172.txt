We're starting from scratch.

Forget Jekyll. Forget Markdown. We are done with static site generators. We need a powerful, clean, futuristic website built entirely with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript ‚Äì no frameworks, no complications ‚Äì designed to host an AI-powered peer learning revolution: PeerGang.

This is not a blog. Not a school page. It's a digital command center for AI-enhanced learning.

üéØ OBJECTIVE:
Design and build a modular, clean, fully HTML-based site that represents the PeerGang initiative. It must be elegant, responsive, and capable of hosting embedded AI Agents (OpenAI, Flowise, n8n, etc.) as sidebars, chat widgets, advisors, and more.

This is a flagship project. Think big.

üí£ DESIGN PRINCIPLES:
- Modern and sharp layout (header, footer, sidebar, clean sectioning)
- Responsive by default (mobile/tablet/desktop)
- Typography-focused for readability
- Dark/light mode switch (optional, but cleanly implemented)
- Visually distinct AI areas (assistant/sidebar/chat/feedback panel)
- Navigation based on real TOC structure of the Peeragogy Handbook (but content can be placeholder for now)
- HTML modularity (each chapter = a clean standalone .html page)
- Each page includes TOC, main content, AI Sidebar, comment box
- Smooth scroll, anchor sync for TOC
- Custom UI for feedback or interaction logging (even if dummy)

üß± FILE STRUCTURE SUGGESTION:
/index.html
/chapters/en/about-this-book.html
/chapters/en/peeragogy-in-a-nutshell.html
/assets/css/
/assets/js/
/assets/images/
/components/ (optional includes: toc.html, ai-sidebar.html, etc.)

üîç AI FUNCTIONALITY (Future-Ready):
- Sidebar space ready for embedded AI (iframe or JS widget)
- Page IDs or slugs ready for content embedding
- Dummy comment system that can evolve into an AI feedback advisor
- Search input ready for vector search (placeholder)

üî• GO:
No more frameworks. No more CMS logic. This is HTML-first, AI-ready, learning-focused and visually elite. Launch a design that speaks for a cognitive revolution.

This is PeerGang. Make it worthy."""
